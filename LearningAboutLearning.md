# Learning about Learning

# Chapter 1
## Thinking
Pinball analogy - rubber bumpers with a pinball machine.

### Focused thinking
Exercing pre-built neural pathways. thinking about things you're somewhat familiar with. Tight bumpers in analogy. Optimal for 20-25 minutes. 

Hint to help with procrastination: use a timer, 'pomedoro', for timing out 25 minutes, and then do some diffuse thinking. 

### Diffuse thinking
Solving or figuring out something new. Happens when going to sleep, creating new pathways and patterns in neural structure. thoughts get stuck less in pre-built pathways and can build new ones. Spacing bumpers wider apart.

go for a walk, take a shower, drift off to sleep.

## Memory
 * Working memory - can hold 4 chunks, have to keep refreshing it, short term, mostly in frontal cortex. Thinks can fall out.
 * Long term memory - present throughout the brain, tons of it, working memory has hooks into long term memory to recall chunks. Might need to have an occasional repetition over multiple days.

## Sleep
 * Sleep is very important. Clears toxins from brain, strengthens new neural pathways, works on complex pathways, erases unneeded pathways.
 * Optimal learning takes place over several days, where each review strengthens the new neural pathways - be it memory or abstract thinking.
 * Strengthens long term memory.


## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
 * Learn by doing, and osmosis of other's knowledge.
 * Diffuse thinking with exercising - takes along a notebook.
 * multitasking is important
 * end of the day, less multitasking, is when best work is done.
 * context switching - good talent to have.

New neurons are accelerated by both:
 * enriched environments (social interaction, food, etc)
 * exercising

Putting yourself in creative environment.


Brain works in parellel.

Success is not necessarily come by being smart. Success is passion and persistance.

# Chapter 2
## Chunking
The accumulation of similar memories, ideas, and processes into one chunk, which can be easily recalled together. Example: putting on a coat / getting dressed. One just has to recall the chunk instead of every complex motion.

Small chunks can be joined into large chunks. Then larger and larger. Best chunks are the ones that are so engrained you don't have to think about connecting them together.

Like language learning.

Starting with examples and working out w/ help or the solution, then focus on WHY the next step is there. By that, think about how to connect to other chunks.

### How to make a chunk
1. Focus completely. Turn off distractions.
2. Understand the idea you're trying to chunk.
  a. Use focused and diffuse if necessary to understand the idea.
  b. Just understanding how a problem was solved doesn't mean you can recall the chunk later. Review is important.
3. You understand and learn when you actually do it yourself.
4. Repeat and practice with related problems. Teaches not only when to USE, but also when NOT to use. Lets you learn how to fit chunk into bigger picture.
5. Practice helps broaden network of neurons accesible to your chunk.

Learning takes place in 2 ways:
1. Bottom up chunking process. Build & strengthen each chunk. How to learn a certain problem solving technique.
2. Top down process that allows you to see what you're learning, where it fits in - diffuse?

Context is where both meet. WHEN to use problem solving technique.

Example, skimming the book first for pictures and broad concepts can help give context. Learn major parts first. Then fill in details.

## Illusions of competence

### Recall
Look away, and see what you can recall. WAY more effective than just 'reading the book' again.  Simply learning and recalling.

When we retrieve knowledge, the retrieval process itself causes us to remember the knowledge better. It's like it builds hooks.

Another way to look at it - when you're first learning, you use your whole working memory. Once it is chunked, it becomes just one slot in working memory.

Just looking at the solution doesn't knit the concept into your brain. Looking is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning.

Highlighting and underlining must be done very carefully - careful not to make it an illusion of competence. If underlining or highlighting, look for key concepts first and read page first, then keep minimal - once per page / paragraph.  Words / notes in margin that synthesize main concepts are good.

Test yourself! It's recall, and it verified whether you grasped it.

Also, recalling material OUTSIDE of place of study can be helpful - cool!

## Motivation

Acetylcholine - activate when you're focused, and basically make the brain ready to form new long term memory. 

dopamine - Motivation is from dopamine. You have dopamine neurons which release the compound, and makes you feel good for both short AND long term projected rewards. That's why dopamine drugs cause issues.

Domapine also signals in relation to unexpected rewards - I think this means that if you get an award that was unexpected, then you get dopamine as well?

Seratonin - alpha males have most. Higher risk behaviors happen with low seratonin.

Emotions effect learning & memory. Amigdela processes memory, decision making, and emotional states.

## Library of Chunks

People gradually build chunks to encrease their intelligence and knowledge.

**Transfer** - using chunks from one field in a different field. For example, problem solving methods can be applied to many things.

Chunk is a way of compressing information compactly.

Diffuse mode can help connect two or more chunks together to solve new problems. Diffuse thinking is thus good tool for problem solving.

Chunk library helps train your brain to recognize different types and classes of concepts.

#### Problem solving

Can be done by **sequential reasoning** - focused mode.
**Intuition/global/holistic** - diffuse mode connections semi-random. But solutions must be verified using focused mode.

### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

Overlearning - good for instances where you might be choking, like a speech, or a test.

Also can be a waist of valuable learning time. Diminishing returns for long term memory solidification, and also can emphasis one chunk too much.

But repeating something you already know perfectly well is easy and illusion of competence.

INSTEAD - balance studies by focusing on what is more difficult.  Called Deliberate practice!

**Einstellung** - initial simple thought that was strengthened may prevent a better solution from being found. Happens with focused mode - in a rut. Like a bad habit.

Mastering - not only basic chunks, but selecting and using different chunks.

Practice by **Interleaving**, which means you go back and forth between different types of problems. Helps you learn WHEN to use a certain technique.

# Conclusions for myself:
 * Focus on exercises in books, and taking notes, instead of just reading.
 * Implement something instead of just reading about it.
 * Use a timer, encourage focused and diffuse thinking
 * start with small mini-chunks by practicing small parts
 * try planning out chunks.
 * test myself!
 * I want to make a library of chunks!
