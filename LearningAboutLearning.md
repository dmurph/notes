# Learning about Learning

 ## Thinking
Pinball analogy - rubber bumpers with a pinball machine.

### Focused thinking
Exercing pre-built neural pathways. thinking about things you're somewhat familiar with. Tight bumpers in analogy. Optimal for 20-25 minutes. 

Hint to help with procrastination: use a timer, 'pomedoro', for timing out 25 minutes, and then do some diffuse thinking. 

### Diffuse thinking
Solving or figuring out something new. Happens when going to sleep, creating new pathways and patterns in neural structure. thoughts get stuck less in pre-built pathways and can build new ones. Spacing bumpers wider apart.

go for a walk, take a shower, drift off to sleep.

## Memory
 * Working memory - can hold 4 chunks, have to keep refreshing it, short term, mostly in frontal cortex
 * Long term memory - present throughout the brain, tons of it, working memory has hooks into long term memory to recall chunks.

## Sleep
 * Sleep is very important. Clears toxins from brain, strengthens new neural pathways, works on complex pathways, erases unneeded pathways.
 * Optimal learning takes place over several days, where each review strengthens the new neural pathways - be it memory or abstract thinking.


## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
 * Learn by doing, and osmosis of other's knowledge.
 * Diffuse thinking with exercising - takes along a notebook.
 * multitasking is important
 * end of the day, less multitasking, is when best work is done.
 * context switching - good talent to have.

New neurons are accelerated by both:
 * enriched environments (social interaction, food, etc)
 * exercising

Putting yourself in creative environment.

Brain works in parellel.

Success is not necessarily come by being smart. Success is passion and persistance.

# Concusions for myself:
 * Focus on exercises in books, and taking notes, instead of just reading.
